#Brief Introduction 

This is the first project from the Odin Curriculum. In this case, we are going to re-create the Google Homepage with plain HTML and CSS. 

Before starting to code, I tried to play a little bit with Figma so I could come up with a few tweaks from the original Google Design. 

This was the first time working with a developer's environment in Linux. At first I was kind of scared with some of the git commands. Nevertheless, after a few starting bugs, the whole experience was a positive one. 

#Goals of the project

- [X] Start thinking about how elements get placed on the page
- [ ] How elements get styled and aligned 
- [ ] Get used to basic Git Commands
- [ ] Implement your own design with Figma
- [ ] Create and Share a Live Preview Simulation of the site

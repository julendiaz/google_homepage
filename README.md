## Brief Introduction 

This is the first project from the Odin Curriculum. In this case, we are going to re-create the Google Homepage with plain HTML and CSS. 

Before starting to code, I tried to play a little bit with Figma so I could come up with a few tweaks from the original Google Design. 

This was the first time working with a developer's environment in Linux. At first I was kind of scared with some of the git commands. Nevertheless, after a few starting bugs, the whole experience was a positive one. 

## Goals of the project

- [X] Start thinking about how elements get placed on the page
- [X] How elements get styled and aligned 
- [X] Get used to basic Git Commands
- [X] Implement your own design with Figma
- [ ] Create and Share a Live Preview Simulation of the site 

## Features 

- Type anything you want in the central search bar
- Hover over elements to see the change in style
- Use the footer to navigate through official Google Links 
- Blops on the background for visual aesthetics 
- Google apps plus Profile pic in the center for simple alignment

## Approaches 

### Search Bar Box-Shadow 

For this feature, I tried different ways of transitioning between shadows and background-colors when hovering the mouse. In the end, I really liked the way panels in "The Odin Project". I tried mimicking that effect by putting a darker color when hovering and using a transition of 2 seconds. 

```css 
#search-nav {
    box-shadow: 0px 4px 31px -8px rgba(80, 80, 80, 0.33);
    transition: 0.2s;
}

#search-nav:hover {
    box-shadow: 0px 4px 31px -8px rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.33);
}
```
### Footer Flex-box

While the grid system is nice for other purposes, I feel now more comfortable with the flex-box method. In this case I just played with the size of the divs and use "space-between" to justify the content. I think it was an easy and light way of separating the different links. 

```css
.footer{
    background-color: #F0F0F0;
    position: fixed;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    height: 80px;
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    font-family: var(--montserrat);
}
```

### Blops Background 

While playing with the design in Figma, I wanted to see if I could add a few colorful tweaks in the background. Not too much, not too little. So I thought about adding some random blops with the four colors of the Google logo. 

At first I thought I could copy and paste the code generated by Figma, but that ended up wrong. That's why I just exported the whole image as a png and added it as a background-image for the body. If you re-size the page it looks a bit weird in some parts but I don't think it looks too bad. 

```css
body {
    background-image: url(/images_reference/google-blops.png);
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
